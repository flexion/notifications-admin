  <p class="font-sans-lg text-base">Flexion Messaging is built for the needs of government agencies with fundamental system
    security processes in place to:

  <ul>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    On Flexion Messaging, data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. To send a message, agencies upload a spreadsheet of
    phone numbers and other necessary data from their existing data management system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flexion Messaging is not a system of record, so it does not have a System of Records Notice (SORN). Agencies are
    responsible for managing their data outside of Flexion Messaging.
  </p>
  <h3>Data retention</h3>
  <p>
    Any data uploads that have recipient data are held for seven calendar days; personally identifiable information
    (PII) is never stored in Flexion Messaging’s database.
  </p>
  <h2>Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    Flexion Messaging uses <a class="use-link usa-link--external"
      href="https://login.gov/what-is-login/"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank"
      aria-label="Login dot gov (opens in a new tab)">Login.gov</a> for enhanced security.
    Login.gov is an extra layer of security created by the government that uses multi-factor authentication and stronger
    passwords to protect your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    To access Flexion Messaging, users will use a Login.gov account associated with their agency (.gov) email with one of the
